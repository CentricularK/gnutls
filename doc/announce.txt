Subject: GnuTLS 3.0.0 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
We are proud to announce a new stable GnuTLS release: Version 3.0.0.

GnuTLS is a modern C library that implements the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications.  GnuTLS is developed for GNU/Linux, but works on many
Unix-like systems and comes with a binary installer for Windows.

The GnuTLS library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License version 2 (or later).  The "extra" GnuTLS
library (which contains), the OpenSSL compatibility library, the self tests
and the command line tools are all distributed under the GNU General
Public License version 3.0 (or later).  The manual is distributed
under the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3 (or later).

The project page of the library is available at:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/

What's New
==========

Version 3.0.0 is the first stable release on the 3.0.x branch and is
the result of 11 months of work on the experimental 2.99.x branch.  The
GnuTLS 3.0.x branch replaces the GnuTLS 2.12.x branch as the supported
stable branch, although we will continue to support GnuTLS 2.12.x for
some time.

** libgnutls: license upgraded to LGPLv3

** libgnutls: depends on nettle 2.2.

** libgnutls: Added Datagram TLS 1.0 support.

** libgnutls: Added Elliptic curve support. Requires priority strings:
+CURVE-ALL: to add all supported curves
+ECDHE-RSA: to add ephemeral ECDHE with an RSA-signed certificate
+ECDHE-ECDSA: to add ephemeral ECDHE with an ECDSA-signed certificate
+ANON-ECDHE: to add anonymous ECDH

** libgnutls: Added ECDHE-PSK ciphersuites for TLS (RFC 5489).

** libgnutls: Added AES in GCM mode

** libgnutls: Added SUITEB128 and SUITEB192 priority
strings to enable the NSA SuiteB cryptography ciphersuites.

** libgnutls: Added AES-GCM optimizations using the PCLMULQDQ
instruction. Uses Andy Polyakov's assembly code.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function() that allows
to get important auditing information including the corresponding session.
That might be useful to block DoS or other attacker from specific IPs.

** libgnutls: gnutls_transport_set_lowat() is no more.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2()
to set a callback to retrieve a certificate. The certificate is
received in a format that requires no processing from gnutls thus
it is suitable when performance is required.

** libgnutls: Simplified the handling of handshake messages to 
be hashed. Instead of hashing during the handshake process we now 
keep the data until handshake is over and hash them on request. 
This uses more memory but eliminates issues with TLS 1.2 and 
simplifies code.

** libgnutls: LZO support was removed.

** libgnutls: gnutls_srp_verifier() returns data allocated with 
gnutls_malloc() for consistency.

** libgnutls-openssl: modified to use modern gnutls' functions.
This introduces an ABI incompatibility with previous versions.

** libgnutls: gnutls_rsa_params_t is now identical to gnutls_x509_privkey_t
to avoid thread-safety issues. Reported by Sam Varshavchik.

** libgnutls: Added new PKCS #11 flags to force an object being private or
not. (GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_PRIVATE and GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_NOT_PRIVATE)

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_x509_crq_verify() to allow
verification of the self signature in a certificate request.
This allows verifying whether the owner of the private key
is the generator of the request.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_set_crq() implicitly verifies
the self signature of the request.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_pubkey_verify_data2() that will
verify data provided the signature algorithm.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt() and
gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt() that allow having a
list of certificates in the trusted list that will be associated
with a name (e.g. server name) and will not be used as CAs.

** libgnutls: PKCS #11 back-end rewritten to use p11-kit
http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/p11-kit.html. Rewrite by
Stef Walter.

** libgnutls: Uses a single configure file and a single
gnulib library to save space.

** libgnutlsxx: The C++ interface returns exception on
every error and not only on fatal ones. This allows easier
handling of errors.

** libgnutls: Corrected issue in DHE-PSK ciphersuites that ignored    
the PSK callback.

** libgnutls: SRP and PSK are no longer set on the default priorities. 
They have to be explicitly set.

** libgnutls: During handshake message verification using DSS
use the hash algorithm required by it.

** libgnutls: gnutls_recv() return GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION
on unexpected EOF, instead of GNUTLS_E_UNEXPECTED_PACKET_LENGTH.

** libgnutls-extra: Inner application extension was removed.
It was never standardized nor published as an RFC.

** libgnutls: Added new certificate verification functions, that
can provide more details and are more efficient. Check 
gnutls_x509_trust_list_*.

** certtool: Uses the new certificate verification functions for
--verify-chain.

** certtool: Added new certificate verification functionality
using the --verify option. Combined with --load-ca-certificate
it can verify a certificate chain against a list of certificates.
